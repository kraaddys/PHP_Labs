One of its main symbols is the pancake (blin), representing the sun, which people eat in large quantities throughout the week. The holiday includes various rituals, such as sledding, fistfights, and the burning of a straw effigy, symbolizing the farewell to winter. Originally a pagan festival, Maslenitsa later became associated with Orthodox Christian traditions as the last week before Lent, during which people enjoy rich foods before fasting. The celebration culminates on Sunday, known as Forgiveness Sunday, when people ask each other for forgiveness and prepare for the spiritual cleansing of Lent.",
